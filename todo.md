# TODO
* push
* clean up notebook
* Filter out Tableaux and other files
* Filter out tokens that aren't terribly helpful.
    * d7  - matches subset of file name but not clear where it comes out in tokens
    * t6,t7, a80  t12 - doesn't seem to show up in file names
    * write a routine that will grab the tokens for sopmething that matches
    * ok. parsing is making a mess. look at that.
        *  0o8mdh91840tc515 -gets parsed out weirdly
     seeing patterns like "'TableauTemp_TEMP_0o8mdh91840tc515x9g910is6eam_sex_58A80FC6F1D746AFA756ACAC09363765_2021-08-17_042302.csv"
