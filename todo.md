# TODO
* push
* clean up notebook
* go to larger corpus
* characterize different kinds of files. and resourdes
* Filter out Tableaux and other files
* Filter out tokens that aren't terribly helpful.
    * d7  - matches subset of file name but not clear where it comes out in tokens
    * t6,t7, a80  t12 - doesn't seem to show up in file names
    * write a routine that will grab the tokens for sopmething that matches
    * ok. parsing is making a mess. look at that.
    * 'cti' is another problem
* make notes of file name patterns that we have pulled out.

* work on nnmf

# DONE
- leave as is. zip codes are ok. we'll just have to characterize those.
